Cristián Iturriaga is a lecturer on Educational Psychology at the Manchester Metropolitan University.  He specialises in education of deaf people, language and literacy from a sociocultural perspective, and qualitative methods with a focus on critical discourse analysis. He is member of SORD (Social Research with Deaf People) group at the University of Manchester and member of LECSOR (Language, Education and Deaf Culture) laboratory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. His thesis explored the relationship between translanguaging, multiple literacies and subjectivities in deaf college students’ learning experiences. 

His PhD thesis analyses the learning experiences of deaf college students, where he explores their translanguaging practices; that is, how do they mix written English, spoken English, British Sign Language, gestures and finger-spelling for communication and understanding purposes.
